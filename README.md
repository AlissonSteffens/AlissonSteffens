Master of Science in Applied Computing with an emphasis on Artificial Intelligence and Game Analytics. Graduated in Computer Science (Univali), with an emphasis on education, computer systems, and games. I like to program 😁. In my free time I usually watch movies, play video games (especially cooperatives) and read.
